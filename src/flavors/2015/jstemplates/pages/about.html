<p>{{#_}}Through Participatory Budgeting, community members - like you - directly decide how to spend at least $1,000,000 of the public budget in your Council District.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}If you have an idea about how things could work better in your community, share it on the map.{{/_}} <a href="/page/guidelines" title="Participatory Budgeting in New York City | REAL MONEY. REAL PROJECTS. REAL POWER.">{{#_}}Check out the guidelines</a> to see what ideas can be funded.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}After you submit your idea on the Idea Collection Map, your idea will be given to the budget delegates working in your district. The budget delegates will then review all the ideas that were submitted, develop ideas into proposals, submit proposals to city agencies, and create a ballot with the approved proposals.{{/_}}</p>
