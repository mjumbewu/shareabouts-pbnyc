<p>{{#_}}Through Participatory Budgeting, community members - like you - directly decide how to spend at least $1,000,000 of the public budget in your Council District.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}If you have an idea about how things could work better in your community, share it on the map.{{/_}} <a href="/page/guidelines" title="Participatory Budgeting in New York City | REAL MONEY. REAL PROJECTS. REAL POWER.">{{#_}}Check out the guidelines</a> to see what ideas can be funded.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}Your idea will be then reviewed, alongside all the others, based on its feasibility, the need it would address, and the number of people it would benefit.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}The top projects will be put on a ballot, and next April, all residents of each participating Council District will be able vote on which to fund.{{/_}}</p>
