<p>{{#_}}Through Participatory Budgeting in New York City (PBNYC), community members &mdash; like you &mdash; directly decide how to spend at least $1,000,000 in participating Council Districts.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}PBNYC funds physical infrastructure projects that benefit the public, cost at least $50,000 and have a lifespan of at least 5 years. Local improvements to schools, parks, libraries, public housing, streets and other public spaces can be funded through this process.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}If you have an idea about how things could work better in your community, share it on the map! <a rel="internal" href="/page/guidelines" title="Participatory Budgeting in New York City | REAL MONEY. REAL PROJECTS. REAL POWER.">Check out the guidelines</a> to see what ideas can be funded.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}After your submission, your ideas are shared with volunteers, called &ldquo;Budget Delegates&rdquo;. Budget Delegates work in your Council District to turn ideas into proposals to go on a ballot, with input from city agencies. These proposals will be up for a community-wide vote next spring from March 25th through April 2nd.{{/_}}</p>
